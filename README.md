# Done as a part of Course Project of  Performance Modelling of Computer Systems !
# Scheduling Algorithms Comparison

This project implements and compares various CPU scheduling algorithms including LIFO (Last-In-First-Out), LIFO-preemptive, FIFO (First-In-First-Out), and RR (Round Robin). It also includes a comparison script to evaluate the performance of these algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
2. LIFO-preemptive
3. FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
4. RR (Round Robin)

## Usage 
```
python3 FIFO.py
python3 LIFO.py
python3 LIFOPR.py
python3 RR.py
python3 compare.py
```
